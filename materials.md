### Devcontainers and Codespaces

One of the easiest ways to get started is to clone your repository and open it
in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a
[devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
VSCode may ask if you want to re-open the project in the devcontainer that is
pre-configured for the course.  If you say yes, VSCode will download the
container, start it, and connect to it remotely. This will take a while the first time, especially 
on a slow internet connection.  The local directory will be
mounted, so your changes in the devcontainer will be reflected in your cloned
workspace.

You can even run the devcontainer in the web interface as a GitHub codespace.
If you click on "Code" and select the "Codespaces" tab, you can create a new
codespace or select one you previously started.
