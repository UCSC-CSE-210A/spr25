## A note on accessibility

If you have a disability and you require accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.ucsc.edu/index.html) to me via the Accommodate system, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter.  I am eager to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to [contact the DRC](https://drc.ucsc.edu/about/contact-us/index.html).
