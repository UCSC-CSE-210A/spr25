(** * The [auto] Tactic *)

(** Thus far, our proof scripts mostly apply relevant hypotheses or
    lemmas by name, and only one at a time. *)

(** The [auto] tactic tries to free us from this drudgery by _searching_
    for a sequence of applications that will prove the goal: *)

Example auto_example_1' : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.
Proof.
  auto.
Qed.

(** The [auto] tactic solves goals that are solvable by any combination of
     - [intros]
    and
     - [apply] (of hypotheses from the local context, by default). *)

(** Here is a larger example showing [auto]'s power: *)

Example auto_example_2 : forall P Q R S T U : Prop,
  (P -> Q) ->
  (P -> R) ->
  (T -> R) ->
  (S -> T -> U) ->
  ((P -> Q) -> (P -> S)) ->
  T ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof. auto. Qed.

(** Proof search could, in principle, take an arbitrarily long time,
    so there are limits to how deep [auto] will search by default. *)

(** If [auto] is not solving our goal as expected we can use [debug auto]
    to see a trace. *)
Example auto_example_3 : forall (P Q R S T U: Prop),
  (P -> Q) ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  (R -> S) ->
  (S -> T) ->
  (T -> U) ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof.
  (* When it cannot solve the goal, [auto] does nothing *)
  auto.

  (* Let's see where [auto] gets stuck using [debug auto] *)
  debug auto.

  (* Optional argument to [auto] says how deep to search
     (default is 5) *)
  auto 6.
Qed.

(** The [auto] tactic considers the hypotheses in the current
    context together with a _hint database_ of other lemmas and
    constructors.

    Some common facts about equality and logical operators are installed in
    the hint database by default. *)

Example auto_example_4 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof. auto. Qed.

(** If we want to see which facts [auto] is using, we can use
    [info_auto] instead. *)

Example auto_example_5: 2 = 2.
Proof.
  info_auto.
Qed.

Example auto_example_5' : forall (P Q R S T U W: Prop),
  (U -> T) ->
  (W -> U) ->
  (R -> S) ->
  (S -> T) ->
  (P -> R) ->
  (U -> T) ->
  P ->
  T.
Proof.
  intros.
  info_auto.
Qed.

(** We can extend the hint database just for the purposes of one
    application of [auto] by writing "[auto using ...]". *)

Lemma le_antisym : forall n m: nat, (n <= m /\ m <= n) -> n = m.
Proof. lia. Qed.

Example auto_example_6 : forall n m p : nat,
  (n <= p -> (n <= m /\ m <= n)) ->
  n <= p ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  auto using le_antisym.
Qed.

(** We can also permanently extend the hint database:

      - [Hint Resolve T : core.]

          Add theorem or constructor [T] to the global DB

      - [Hint Constructors c : core.]

          Add _all_ constructors of [c] to the global DB

      - [Hint Unfold d : core.]

          Automatically expand defined symbol [d] during [auto] *)

(** It is also possible to define specialized hint databases (besides
    [core]) that can be activated only when needed; indeed, it is good
    style to create your own hint databases instead of polluting
    [core].

    See the Coq reference manual for details. *)

Hint Resolve le_antisym : core.

Example auto_example_6' : forall n m p : nat,
  (n<= p -> (n <= m /\ m <= n)) ->
  n <= p ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  auto. (* picks up hint from database *)
Qed.

Definition is_fortytwo x := (x = 42).

Example auto_example_7: forall x,
  (x <= 42 /\ 42 <= x) -> is_fortytwo x.
Proof.
  auto.  (* does nothing *)
Abort.

Hint Unfold is_fortytwo : core.

Example auto_example_7' : forall x,
  (x <= 42 /\ 42 <= x) -> is_fortytwo x.
Proof.
  auto. (* try also: info_auto. *)

(** Let's take a first pass over [ceval_deterministic] to simplify the
    proof script. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic': forall c st st1 st2,

(** * Searching For Hypotheses *)

(** The proof has become simpler, but there is still an annoying
    amount of repetition.

    Let's first tackle the contradiction cases.  Each occurs where we
    have hypothesis of the form

      H1: beval st b = false

    as well as:

      H2: beval st b = true

    First step: abstracting out that piece as a script in Ltac. *)

Ltac rwd H1 H2 := rewrite H1 in H2; discriminate.

(** Using [rwd]... *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic'': forall c st st1 st2,
  st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
  st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2.
  generalize dependent st2;
  induction E1; intros st2 E2; inversion E2; subst; auto.

  - (* E_IfTrue *)
      rwd H H5.
  - (* E_IfFalse *)

  - (* E_WhileFalse *)
      rwd H H2.
  - (* E_WhileTrue - b false *)
    rwd H H4.
  - (* EWhileTrue - b true *)
    rewrite (IHE1_1 st'0 H3) in *.
    auto. Qed.

(** That was a bit better, but we really want Coq to discover the
    relevant hypotheses for us.  We can do this by using the [match
    goal] facility of Ltac. *)

Ltac find_rwd :=
  match goal with
    H1: ?E = true,
    H2: ?E = false
    |- _ => rwd H1 H2
  end.

(** The [match goal] tactic looks for hypotheses matching the
    pattern specified. In this case, we're looking for two equalities
    [H1] and [H2] equating the same expression [?E] to both [true] and
    [false]. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic''': forall c st st1 st2,
  st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
  st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2.

    auto.
  - (* E_WhileTrue - b true *)
    rewrite (IHE1_1 st'0 H3) in *.
    auto. Qed.

(** Let's see about the remaining cases. Each of them involves
    rewriting a hypothesis after feeding it with the required
    condition. We can automate the task of finding the relevant
    hypotheses to rewrite with. *)

Ltac find_eqn :=
  match goal with
    H1: forall x, ?P x -> ?L = ?R,
    H2: ?P ?X
    |- _ => rewrite (H1 X H2) in *
  end.

(** Now we can make use of [find_eqn] to repeatedly rewrite
    with the appropriate hypothesis, wherever it may be found. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic'''': forall c st st1 st2,
  st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
  st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2.
  generalize dependent st2;
  induction E1; intros st2 E2; inversion E2; subst; try find_rwd;
    try find_eqn; auto.
Qed.

(** The big payoff in this approach is that our proof script should be
    more robust in the face of modest changes to our language.  To
    test this, let's try adding a [REPEAT] command to the language. *)

  | CRepeat (c : com) (b : bexp).

(** [REPEAT] behaves like [while], except that the loop guard is
    checked _after_ each execution of the body, with the loop
    repeating as long as the guard stays _false_.  Because of this,
    the body will always execute at least once. *)

(** * The [eapply] and [eauto] tactics *)

(** Recall this example from the [Imp] chapter: *)

Example ceval_example1:
  empty_st =[
    X := 2;
    if (X <= 1)
      then Y := 3
      else Z := 4
    end
  ]=> (Z !-> 4 ; X !-> 2).
Proof.
  (* We supply the intermediate state [st']... *)
  apply E_Seq with (X !-> 2).
  - apply E_Asgn. reflexivity.
  - apply E_IfFalse. reflexivity. apply E_Asgn. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** In the first step of the proof, we had to explicitly provide
    the intermediate state [X !-> 2], due to the "hidden" argument [st']
    to the [E_Seq] constructor:

          E_Seq : forall c1 c2 st st' st'',

            st' =[ c2 ]=> st'' ->

*)

(** If we leave out the [with], this step fails, because Coq cannot
    find an instance for the variable [st']. But this is silly! The appropriate
    value for [st'] will become obvious in the very next step. *)

(** With [eapply], we can eliminate this silliness: *)

Example ceval'_example1:
  empty_st =[
    X := 2;
    if (X <= 1)
      then Y := 3

(** Several of the tactics that we've seen so far, including [exists],
    [constructor], and [auto], have similar variants. The [eauto]
    tactic works like [auto], except that it uses [eapply] instead of
    [apply].  Tactic [info_eauto] shows us which tactics [eauto] uses
    in its proof search.

    Below is an example of [eauto].  Before using it, we need to give

    and the definitions of [state] and [total_map] as part of its
