(** * The [apply] Tactic *)

(** The [apply] tactic is useful when some hypothesis or an
    earlier lemma exactly matches the goal: *)

Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m eq.

(** Here, we could finish with "[rewrite -> eq.  reflexivity.]" as we
    have done several times before.  Or we can finish in a single step
    by using [apply]: *)

  apply eq.  Qed.

(** [apply] also works with _conditional_ hypotheses: *)

Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
  n = m ->
  (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
  [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** Observe how Coq picks appropriate values for the
    [forall]-quantified variables of the hypothesis: *)

Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
  (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
  (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** The goal must match the hypothesis _exactly_ for [apply] to
    work: *)

Theorem silly3 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  m = n.
Proof.
  intros n m H.

  (** Here we cannot use [apply] directly... *)

  Fail apply H.

  (** but we can use the [symmetry] tactic, which switches the left
      and right sides of an equality in the goal. *)

  symmetry. apply H.  Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [apply with] Tactic *)

(** The following silly example uses two rewrites in a row to
    get from [[a;b]] to [[e;f]]. *)

Example trans_eq_example : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  rewrite -> eq1. apply eq2. Qed.

(** Since this is a common pattern, we might like to pull it out as a
    lemma that records, once and for all, the fact that equality is
    transitive. *)

Theorem trans_eq : forall (X:Type) (x y z : X),
  x = y -> y = z -> x = z.
Proof.
  intros X x y z eq1 eq2. rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2.
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Applying this lemma to the example above requires a slight
    refinement of [apply]: *)

Example trans_eq_example' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.

  (** Doing [apply trans_eq] doesn't work!  But... *)
  apply trans_eq with (y:=[c;d]).
  (** does. *)

  apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(** [transitivity] is also available as a tactic. *)

Example trans_eq_example'' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  transitivity [c;d].
  apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [injection] and [discriminate] Tactics *)

(** The constructors of inductive types are _injective_ (or
    _one-to-one_) and _disjoint_.

    E.g., for [nat]...

       - if [S n = S m] then it must be that [n = m]

       - [O] is not equal to [S n] for any [n]
 *)

(** We can _prove_ the injectivity of [S] by using the [pred] function
    defined in [Basics.v]. *)

Theorem S_injective : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H1.
  assert (H2: n = pred (S n)). { reflexivity. }
  rewrite H2. rewrite H1. simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** As a convenience, the [injection] tactic allows us to
    exploit injectivity of any constructor (not just [S]). *)

Theorem S_injective' : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H.
  injection H as Hnm. apply Hnm.
Qed.

(** Here's a more interesting example that shows how [injection] can
    derive multiple equations at once. *)

Theorem injection_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n;m] = [o;o] ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m o H.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** So much for injectivity of constructors.  What about disjointness? *)

(** Two terms beginning with different constructors (like
    [O] and [S], or [true] and [false]) can never be equal! *)

(** The [discriminate] tactic embodies this principle: It is used
    on a hypothesis involving an equality between different
    constructors (e.g., [false = true]), and it solves the current
    goal immediately.  Some examples: *)

Theorem discriminate_ex1 : forall (n m : nat),
  false = true ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

Theorem discriminate_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O ->
  2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

(** These examples are instances of a logical principle known as the
    _principle of explosion_, which asserts that a contradictory
    hypothesis entails anything (even manifestly false things!). *)

(** For a more useful example, we can use [discriminate] to make a
    connection between the two different notions of equality ([=] and
    [=?]) that we have seen for natural numbers. *)
Theorem eqb_0_l : forall n,
   0 =? n = true -> n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n.

  destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - (* n = 0 *)
    intros H. reflexivity.

  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl.

    intros H. discriminate H.
Qed.

    (2) The tactic fails.

    (3) Hypothesis [H] becomes [Hxy : x = y].

    (4) None of the above.

*)

(** The injectivity of constructors allows us to reason that
    [forall (n m : nat), S n = S m -> n = m].  The converse of this
    implication is an instance of a more general fact about both
    constructors and functions, which we will find convenient
    below: *)

Theorem f_equal : forall (A B : Type) (f: A -> B) (x y: A),
  x = y -> f x = f y.
Proof. intros A B f x y eq. rewrite eq.  reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. apply f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(** Coq also provides an [f_equal] tactic. *)

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal' : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)

(** Many tactics come with "[... in ...]" variants that work on
    hypotheses instead of goals. *)

Theorem S_inj : forall (n m : nat) (b : bool),
  ((S n) =? (S m)) = b  ->
  (n =? m) = b.
Proof.
  intros n m b H. simpl in H. apply H.  Qed.

(** The ordinary [apply] tactic is a form of "backward
    reasoning."  It says "We're trying to prove [X] and we know
    [Y -> X], so if we can prove [Y] we'll be done."

    By contrast, the variant [apply... in...] is "forward reasoning":
    it says "We know [Y] and we know [Y -> X], so we also know [X]." *)

Theorem silly4 : forall (n m p q : nat),
  (n = m -> p = q) ->
  m = n ->
  q = p.
Proof.
  intros n m p q EQ H.
  symmetry in H. apply EQ in H. symmetry in H.
  apply H.  Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Specializing Hypotheses *)

(** Another handy tactic for fiddling with hypotheses is [specialize].
    It is essentially just a combination of [assert] and [apply], but
    it often provides a pleasingly smooth way to nail down overly
    general assumptions.  It works like this:

    If [H] is a quantified hypothesis in the current context -- i.e.,
    [H : forall (x:T), P] -- then [specialize H with (x := e)] will
    change [H] so that it looks like [[x:=e]P], that is, [P] with [x]
    replaced by [e].

    For example: *)

Theorem specialize_example: forall n,
     (forall m, m*n = 0)
  -> n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n H.
  specialize H with (m := 1).
  rewrite mult_1_l in H.
  apply H. Qed.

(** Using [specialize] before [apply] gives us yet another way to
    control where [apply] does its work. *)
Example trans_eq_example''' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  specialize trans_eq with (y:=[c;d]) as H.
  apply H.
  apply eq1.
  apply eq2. Qed.
(** Note:
    - We can [specialize] facts in the global context, not just
      local hypotheses.
    - The [as...] clause at the end tells [specialize] how to name
      the new hypothesis in this case. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Varying the Induction Hypothesis *)

(** Recall this function for doubling a natural number from the
    [Induction] chapter: *)

Fixpoint double (n:nat) :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S n' => S (S (double n'))
  end.

(** Suppose we want to show that [double] is injective (i.e.,
    it maps different arguments to different results).  The way we
    _start_ this proof is a little bit delicate: *)

Theorem double_injective_FAILED : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.
  - (* n = S n' *) intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* m = S m' *) f_equal.

(** At this point, the induction hypothesis ([IHn']) does _not_ give us
    [n' = m'] -- there is an extra [S] in the way -- so the goal is
    not provable. *)

Abort.
(** What went wrong? *)

(** Trying to carry out this proof by induction on [n] when [m] is
    already in the context doesn't work because we are then trying to
    prove a statement involving _every_ [n] but just a _particular_
    [m]. *)

(** A successful proof of [double_injective] leaves [m] universally
    quantified in the goal statement at the point where the
    [induction] tactic is invoked on [n]: *)

Theorem double_injective : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros m eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.

  - (* n = S n' *)
    intros m eq.
    destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *)
    discriminate eq.
    + (* m = S m' *)
      f_equal.
      apply IHn'. simpl in eq. injection eq as goal. apply goal. Qed.

(** The thing to take away from all this is that you need to be
    careful, when using induction, that you are not trying to prove
    something too specific: When proving a property quantified over
    variables [n] and [m] by induction on [n], it is sometimes crucial
    to leave [m] generic. *)

(** The following theorem, which further strengthens the link between
    [=?] and [=], follows the same pattern. *)
Theorem eqb_true : forall n m,
  n =? m = true -> n = m.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** The strategy of doing fewer [intros] before an [induction] to
    obtain a more general IH doesn't always work; sometimes some
    _rearrangement_ of quantified variables is needed.  Suppose, for
    example, that we wanted to prove [double_injective] by induction
    on [m] instead of [n]. *)

Theorem double_injective_take2_FAILED : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction m as [| m' IHm'].
  - (* m = O *) simpl. intros eq. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
    + (* n = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* n = S n' *) discriminate eq.
  - (* m = S m' *) intros eq. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
    + (* n = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* n = S n' *) f_equal.
        (* We are stuck here, just like before. *)
Abort.

(** The problem is that, to do induction on [m], we must first
    introduce [n].  (If we simply say [induction m] without
    introducing anything first, Coq will automatically introduce [n]
    for us!)  *)

(** What can we do about this?  One possibility is to rewrite the
    statement of the lemma so that [m] is quantified before [n].  This
    works, but it's not nice: We don't want to have to twist the
    statements of lemmas to fit the needs of a particular strategy for
    proving them!  Rather we want to state them in the clearest and
    most natural way. *)

(** What we can do instead is to first introduce all the quantified
    variables and then _re-generalize_ one or more of them,
    selectively taking variables out of the context and putting them
    back at the beginning of the goal.  The [generalize dependent]
    tactic does this. *)

Theorem double_injective_take2 : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  (* [n] and [m] are both in the context *)
  generalize dependent n.
  (* Now [n] is back in the goal and we can do induction on
     [m] and get a sufficiently general IH. *)

    + (* n = S n' *) f_equal.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Unfolding Definitions *)

(** It sometimes happens that we need to manually unfold a name that
    has been introduced by a [Definition] so that we can manipulate
    the expression it stands for.

    For example, if we define... *)

Definition square n := n * n.

(** ...and try to prove a simple fact about [square]... *)

Lemma square_mult : forall n m, square (n * m) = square n * square m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  simpl.

(** ...we appear to be stuck: [simpl] doesn't simplify anything, and
    since we haven't proved any other facts about [square], there is
    nothing we can [apply] or [rewrite] with. *)

(** To make progress, we can manually [unfold] the definition of
    [square]: *)

  unfold square.

(** Now we have plenty to work with: both sides of the equality are
    expressions involving multiplication, and we have lots of facts
    about multiplication at our disposal.  In particular, we know that
    it is commutative and associative, and from these it is not hard
    to finish the proof. *)

  rewrite mult_assoc.
  assert (H : n * m * n = n * n * m).
    { rewrite mul_comm. apply mult_assoc. }
  rewrite H. rewrite mult_assoc. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** At this point, a bit deeper discussion of unfolding and
    simplification is in order.

    We already have observed that tactics like [simpl], [reflexivity],
    and [apply] will often unfold the definitions of functions
    automatically when this allows them to make progress.  For
    example, if we define [foo m] to be the constant [5]... *)

Definition foo (x: nat) := 5.

(** .... then the [simpl] in the following proof (or the
    [reflexivity], if we omit the [simpl]) will unfold [foo m] to
    [(fun x => 5) m] and further simplify this expression to just
    [5]. *)

Fact silly_fact_1 : forall m, foo m + 1 = foo (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** But this automatic unfolding is somewhat conservative.  For
    example, if we define a slightly more complicated function
    involving a pattern match... *)

Definition bar x :=
  match x with
  | O => 5
  | S _ => 5
  end.

(** ...then the analogous proof will get stuck: *)

Fact silly_fact_2_FAILED : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** The reason that [simpl] doesn't make progress here is that it
    notices that, after tentatively unfolding [bar m], it is left with
    a match whose scrutinee, [m], is a variable, so the [match] cannot
    be simplified further.  It is not smart enough to notice that the
    two branches of the [match] are identical, so it gives up on
    unfolding [bar m] and leaves it alone.

    Similarly, tentatively unfolding [bar (m+1)] leaves a [match]
    whose scrutinee is a function application (that cannot itself be
    simplified, even after unfolding the definition of [+]), so
    [simpl] leaves it alone. *)

(** There are now two ways make progress.

    (1) Use [destruct m] to break the proof into two cases: *)

Fact silly_fact_2 : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  destruct m eqn:E.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** This approach works, but it depends on our recognizing that the
    [match] hidden inside [bar] is what was preventing us from making
    progress. *)

(** (2) Explicitly tell Coq to unfold [bar]. *)

Fact silly_fact_2' : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  unfold bar.

(** Now it is apparent that we are stuck on the [match] expressions on
    both sides of the [=], and we can use [destruct] to finish the
    proof without thinking so hard. *)

  destruct m eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.
Qed.

(** * Using [destruct] on Compound Expressions *)

(** The [destruct] tactic can be used on expressions as well as
