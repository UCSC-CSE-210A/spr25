(** * Pairs of Numbers *)

(** An [Inductive] definition of pairs of numbers.  It has just
    one constructor, taking two arguments: *)

Inductive natprod : Type :=
  | pair (n1 n2 : nat).

Check (pair 3 5) : natprod.

(** Functions for extracting the first and second components of a pair
    can then be defined by pattern matching. *)

Definition fst (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | pair x y => x
  end.

Definition snd (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | pair x y => y
  end.

Compute (fst (pair 3 5)).
(* ===> 3 *)

(** A nicer notation for pairs: *)

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).

(** The new notation can be used both in expressions and in pattern
    matches. *)

Compute (fst (3,5)).

Definition fst' (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => x
  end.

Definition snd' (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => y
  end.

Definition swap_pair (p : natprod) : natprod :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => (y,x)
  end.

(** If we state properties of pairs in a slightly peculiar way, we can
    sometimes complete their proofs with just reflexivity and its
    built-in simplification: *)

Theorem surjective_pairing' : forall (n m : nat),
  (n,m) = (fst (n,m), snd (n,m)).
Proof.
  reflexivity. Qed.

(** But just [reflexivity] is not enough if we state the lemma in a more
    natural way: *)

Theorem surjective_pairing_stuck : forall (p : natprod),
  p = (fst p, snd p).
Proof.
  simpl. (* Doesn't reduce anything! *)
Abort.

(** Solution: use [destruct]. *)

Theorem surjective_pairing : forall (p : natprod),
  p = (fst p, snd p).
Proof.
  intros p. destruct p as [n m]. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** * Lists of Numbers *)

(** An inductive definition of _lists_ of numbers: *)

Inductive natlist : Type :=
  | nil
  | cons (n : nat) (l : natlist).

Definition mylist := cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)).

(** Some notation for lists to make our lives easier: *)

Notation "x :: l" := (cons x l)
                     (at level 60, right associativity).
Notation "[ ]" := nil.
Notation "[ x ; .. ; y ]" := (cons x .. (cons y nil) ..).

(** Now these all mean exactly the same thing: *)

Definition mylist1 := 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: nil)).
Definition mylist2 := 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: nil.
Definition mylist3 := [1;2;3].

(** Some useful list-manipulation functions... *)

Fixpoint app (l1 l2 : natlist) : natlist :=

  end.

Notation "x ++ y" := (app x y)
                     (right associativity, at level 60).

Example test_app1:             [1;2;3] ++ [4;5] = [1;2;3;4;5].

(** As with numbers, some proofs about list functions need only
    simplification... *)

Theorem nil_app : forall l : natlist,
  [] ++ l = l.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ...and some need case analysis. *)

Theorem tl_length_pred : forall l:natlist,
  pred (length l) = length (tl l).
Proof.
  intros l. destruct l as [| n l'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons n l' *)
    reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Usually, though, interesting theorems about lists require
    induction for their proofs.  We'll see how to do this next. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Lists *)

(** Coq generates an induction principle for every [Inductive]
    definition, including lists.  We can use the [induction] tactic on
    lists to prove things like the associativity of list-append... *)

Theorem app_assoc : forall l1 l2 l3 : natlist,
  (l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3).
Proof.
  intros l1 l2 l3. induction l1 as [| n l1' IHl1'].
  - (* l1 = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l1 = cons n l1' *)
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl1'. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** For comparison, here is an informal proof of the same theorem. *)

(** _Theorem_: For all lists [l1], [l2], and [l3],
               [(l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3)].

   _Proof_: By induction on [l1].

   - First, suppose [l1 = []].  We must show

       ([] ++ l2) ++ l3 = [] ++ (l2 ++ l3),

     which follows directly from the definition of [++].

   - Next, suppose [l1 = n::l1'], with

       (l1' ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1' ++ (l2 ++ l3)

     (the induction hypothesis). We must show

       ((n :: l1') ++ l2) ++ l3 = (n :: l1') ++ (l2 ++ l3).

     By the definition of [++], this follows from

       n :: ((l1' ++ l2) ++ l3) = n :: (l1' ++ (l2 ++ l3)),

     which is immediate from the induction hypothesis.  [] *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Generalizing Statements *)

(** Sometimes statements need to be generalized to proof them by
    induction:  *)

Theorem repeat_double_firsttry : forall c n: nat,
  repeat n c ++ repeat n c = repeat n (c + c).
Proof.
  intros c. induction c as [| c' IHc'].
  - (* c = 0 *)
    intros n. simpl. reflexivity.
  - (* c = S c' *)
    intros n. simpl.
    (*  Now we seem to be stuck.  The IH cannot be used to
        rewrite [repeat n (c' + S c')]: it only works
        for [repeat n (c' + c')]. If the IH were more liberal here
        (e.g., if it worked for an arbitrary second summand),
        the proof would go through. *)
Abort.

(** A generalization of the statement that gives a stronger
    inductive hypothesis: *)

Theorem repeat_plus: forall c1 c2 n: nat,
    repeat n c1 ++ repeat n c2 = repeat n (c1 + c2).
Proof.
  intros c1 c2 n.
  induction c1 as [| c1' IHc1'].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    rewrite <- IHc1'.
    reflexivity.
  Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Reversing a List *)

(** A more interesting example of induction over lists: *)

Fixpoint rev (l:natlist) : natlist :=
  match l with
  | nil    => nil
  | h :: t => rev t ++ [h]
  end.

Example test_rev1:            rev [1;2;3] = [3;2;1].
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_rev2:            rev nil = nil.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Let's try to prove [length (rev l) = length l]. *)

Theorem rev_length_firsttry : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = n :: l' *)
    simpl.
    rewrite <- IHl'.
Abort.

(** A first attempt: *)
Theorem app_rev_length_S_firsttry: forall l n,
  length (rev l ++ [n]) = S (length (rev l)).
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    intros n. simpl. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m:: l' *)
    intros n. simpl.
    (* IHl' not applicable. *)
Abort.

(** A slightly strenghtened statement: *)
Theorem app_length_S: forall l n,
  length (l ++ [n]) = S (length l).
Proof.
  intros l n. induction l as [| m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m:: l' *)
    simpl.
    rewrite IHl'.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Now we can complete the original proof. *)

Theorem rev_length : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons *)
    simpl.
    rewrite -> app_length_S.
    rewrite -> IHl'.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(** We can also prove a more general form of app_length_S that
    gives the length of any two appended lists. *)
Theorem app_length : forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  length (l1 ++ l2) = (length l1) + (length l2).
Proof.

(** * Partial Maps *)

(** As a final illustration of how data structures can be defined in
    Coq, here is a simple _partial map_ data type, analogous to the
    map or dictionary data structures found in most programming
    languages. *)

(** First, we define a new inductive datatype [id] to serve as the
    "keys" of our partial maps. *)

Inductive id : Type :=
  | Id (n : nat).

(** Internally, an [id] is just a number.  Introducing a separate type
    by wrapping each nat with the tag [Id] makes definitions more
    readable and gives us flexibility to change representations later
    if we want to. *)

(** We'll also need an equality test for [id]s: *)

Definition eqb_id (x1 x2 : id) :=
  match x1, x2 with
  | Id n1, Id n2 => n1 =? n2
  end.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (eqb_id_refl) *)
Theorem eqb_id_refl : forall x, eqb_id x x = true.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** Now we define the type of partial maps: *)

Module PartialMap.
Export NatList.  (* make the definitions from NatList available here *)

Inductive partial_map : Type :=
  | empty
  | record (i : id) (v : nat) (m : partial_map).

(** The [update] function overrides the entry for a given key in a
    partial map by shadowing it with a new one (or simply adds a new
    entry if the given key is not already present). *)

Definition update (d : partial_map)
                  (x : id) (value : nat)
                  : partial_map :=
  record x value d.

(** We can define functions on [partial_map]s by pattern matching. *)

Fixpoint find (x : id) (d : partial_map) : natoption :=
  match d with
  | empty         => None
  | record y v d' => if eqb_id x y
                     then Some v
                     else find x d'
  end.
