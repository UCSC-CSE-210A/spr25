(** * Decorated Programs *)

(** The beauty of Hoare Logic is that it is _structure-guided_: the
    structure of proofs exactly follows the structure of programs.

    We can record the essential ideas of a Hoare-logic proof --
    omitting low-level calculational details -- by "decorating" a
    program with appropriate assertions on each of its commands.

    Such a _decorated program_ carries within itself an argument for
    its own correctness. *)

(** For example, consider the program:

    X := m;
    Z := p;
    while X <> 0 do
      Z := Z - 1;
      X := X - 1
    end
*)
(** Here is one possible specification for this program, in the
    form of a Hoare triple:

    {{ True }}
    X := m;
    Z := p;
    while X <> 0 do
      Z := Z - 1;
      X := X - 1
    end
    {{ Z = p - m }}
*)

(** Here is a decorated version of this program, embodying a
    proof of this specification:

    {{ True }} ->>
    {{ m = m }}
      X := m
                         {{ X = m }} ->>
                         {{ X = m /\ p = p }};
      Z := p;
                         {{ X = m /\ Z = p }} ->>
                         {{ Z - X = p - m }}
      while X <> 0 do
                         {{ Z - X = p - m /\ X <> 0 }} ->>
                         {{ (Z - 1) - (X - 1) = p - m }}
        Z := Z - 1
                         {{ Z - (X - 1) = p - m }};
        X := X - 1
                         {{ Z - X = p - m }}
      end
    {{ Z - X = p - m /\ ~ (X <> 0) }} ->>
    {{ Z = p - m }}
*)

(** Concretely, a decorated program consists of the program's text
    interleaved with assertions (sometimes multiple assertions
    separated by implications). *)

(** A decorated program can be viewed as a compact representation of a
    proof in Hoare Logic: the assertions surrounding each command
    specify the Hoare triple to be proved for that part of the program
    using one of the Hoare Logic rules, and the structure of the
    program itself shows how to assemble all these individual steps
    into a proof for the whole program. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Swapping *)

(** Consider the following program, which swaps the values of two
    variables using addition and subtraction (instead of by assigning
    to a temporary variable).

       X := X + Y;
       Y := X - Y;
       X := X - Y

    We can give a proof, in the form of decorations, that this program is
    correct -- i.e., it really swaps [X] and [Y] -- as follows. *)
(* WORK IN CLASS *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Simple Conditionals *)

(** Here's a simple program using conditionals, along
    with a possible specification:

     {{ True }}
       if X <= Y then
         Z := Y - X
       else
         Z := X - Y
       end
     {{ Z + X = Y \/ Z + Y = X }}

    Let's turn it into a decorated program...
*)
(* WORK IN CLASS *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Reduce to Zero *)

(** Here is a very simple [while] loop with a simple
    specification:

        {{ True }}
          while (X <> 0) do
            X := X - 1
          end
        {{ X = 0 }}
*)
(* WORK IN CLASS *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Division *)

(** Let's do one more example of simple reasoning about a loop.

    The following Imp program calculates the integer quotient and
    remainder of parameters [m] and [n].

       X := m;
       Y := 0;
       while n <= X do
         X := X - n;
         Y := Y + 1
       end;

    If we replace [m] and [n] by concrete numbers and execute the program, it
    will terminate with the variable [X] set to the remainder when [m]
    is divided by [n] and [Y] set to the quotient.

    Here's a possible specification:

      {{ True }}
        X := m;
        Y := 0;
        while n <= X do
          X := X - n;
          Y := Y + 1
        end
      {{ n * Y + X = m /\ X < n }}
*)

(** ** From Decorated Programs to Formal Proofs *)

(** From an informal proof in the form of a decorated program, it is
    "easy in principle" to read off a formal proof using the Coq
    theorems corresponding to the Hoare Logic rules, but these proofs
    can be a bit long and fiddly. *)

(** This example shows that it is conceptually straightforward to read

    Indeed, the process is so straightforward that it can be
    automated, as we will see next. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Formal Decorated Programs *)

(** With a little more work, we can _formalize_ the definition of
    well-formed decorated programs and _automate_ the boring mechanical
    steps in proving that the decorations are correct. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** The first thing we need to do is to formalize a variant of the
    syntax of Imp commands that includes embedded assertions, which
    we'll call "decorations."  We call the new commands _decorated
    commands_, or [dcom]s.

    The choice of exactly where to put assertions in the definition of
    [dcom] is a bit subtle.  The simplest thing to do would be to
    annotate every [dcom] with a precondition and postcondition --
    something like this... *)

Module DComFirstTry.

Inductive dcom : Type :=
| DCSkip (P : Assertion)
  (* {{ P }} skip {{ P }} *)
| DCSeq (P : Assertion) (d1 : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
        (d2 : dcom) (R : Assertion)
  (* {{ P }} d1 {{Q}}; d2 {{ R }} *)
| DCAsgn (X : string) (a : aexp) (Q : Assertion)
  (* etc. *)
| DCIf (P : Assertion) (b : bexp) (P1 : Assertion) (d1 : dcom)
       (P2 : Assertion) (d2 : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
| DCWhile (P : Assertion) (b : bexp)
          (P1 : Assertion) (d : dcom) (P2 : Assertion)
          (Q : Assertion)
| DCPre (P : Assertion) (d : dcom)
| DCPost (d : dcom) (Q : Assertion).

End DComFirstTry.

(** But this would result in _very_ verbose decorated programs with a
    lot of repeated annotations: even a simple program like
    [skip;skip] would be decorated like this,

        {{P}} ({{P}} skip {{P}}) ; ({{P}} skip {{P}}) {{P}}

    with pre- and post-conditions around each [skip], plus identical
    pre- and post-conditions on the semicolon! *)

(** In other words, we don't want both preconditions and
    postconditions on each command, because a sequence of two commands
    would contain redundant decorations--the postcondition of the
    first likely being the same as the precondition of the second.

    Instead, the formal syntax of decorated commands omits
    preconditions whenever possible, trying to embed just the
    postcondition. *)

(** - The [skip] command, for example, is decorated only with its
      postcondition

      skip {{ Q }}

      on the assumption that the precondition will be provided by the
      context.

      We carry the same assumption through the other syntactic forms:
      each decorated command is assumed to carry its own postcondition
      within itself but take its precondition from its context in
      which it is used. *)

(** - Sequences [d1 ; d2] need no additional decorations.

      Why?

      Because inside [d2] there will be a postcondition; this serves
      as the postcondition of [d1;d2].

      Similarly, inside [d1] there will also be a postcondition, which
      additionally serves as the _precondition_ for [d2]. *)

(** - An assignment [X := a] is decorated only with its postcondition:

      X := a {{ Q }}
*)

(** - A conditional [if b then d1 else d2] is decorated with a
      postcondition for the entire statement, as well as preconditions
      for each branch:

      if b then {{ P1 }} d1 else {{ P2 }} d2 end {{ Q }}
*)

(** - A loop [while b do d end] is decorated with its postcondition
      and a precondition for the body:

      while b do {{ P }} d end {{ Q }}

      The postcondition embedded in [d] serves as the loop invariant. *)

(** - Implications [->>] can be added as decorations either for a
      precondition

      ->> {{ P }} d

      or for a postcondition

      d ->> {{ Q }}

      The former is waiting for another precondition to be supplied by
      the context (e.g., [{{ P'}} ->> {{ P }} d]); the latter relies
      on the postcondition already embedded in [d]. *)

(** Putting this all together gives us the formal syntax of decorated
    commands: *)

Inductive dcom : Type :=
| DCSkip (Q : Assertion)
  (* skip {{ Q }} *)
| DCSeq (d1 d2 : dcom)
  (* d1 ; d2 *)
| DCAsgn (X : string) (a : aexp) (Q : Assertion)
  (* X := a {{ Q }} *)
| DCIf (b : bexp) (P1 : Assertion) (d1 : dcom)
       (P2 : Assertion) (d2 : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
  (* if b then {{ P1 }} d1 else {{ P2 }} d2 end {{ Q }} *)
| DCWhile (b : bexp) (P : Assertion) (d : dcom)
          (Q : Assertion)
  (* while b do {{ P }} d end {{ Q }} *)
| DCPre (P : Assertion) (d : dcom)
  (* ->> {{ P }} d *)
| DCPost (d : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
  (* d ->> {{ Q }} *).

(** (We then need to redefine all our Notations to get nice
    concrete syntax for [dcom].) *)

(** To provide the initial precondition that goes at the very top of a
    decorated program, we introduce a new type [decorated]: *)

Inductive decorated : Type :=
  | Decorated : Assertion -> dcom -> decorated.

(** To avoid clashing with the existing [Notation]s for ordinary
    commands, we introduce these notations in a new grammar scope
    called [dcom]. *)

Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The outer Hoare triple of a decorated program is just a [Prop];
    thus, to show that it is _valid_, we need to produce a proof of
    this proposition.

    We will do this by extracting "proof obligations" from the
    decorations sprinkled through the program.

    These obligations are often called _verification conditions_,
    because they are the facts that must be verified to see that the
    decorations are locally consistent and thus constitute a proof of
    validity of the outer triple. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Extracting Verification Conditions *)

(** The function [verification_conditions] takes a decorated command
    [d] together with a precondition [P] and returns a _proposition_
    that, if it can be proved, implies that the triple

     {{P}} erase d {{post d}}

    is valid.

    It does this by walking over [d] and generating a big conjunction
    that includes

    - local consistency checks for each form of command, plus

    - uses of [->>] to bridge the gap between the assertions found
      inside a decorated command and the assertions imposed by the
      precondition from its context; these uses correspond to
      applications of the consequence rule.

    _Local consistency_ is defined as follows... *)

(** - The decorated command

*)
(** - The sequential composition of [d1] and [d2] is locally
      consistent with respect to [P] if [d1] is locally consistent with
      respect to [P] and [d2] is locally consistent with respect to
      the postcondition of [d1].

    - An assignment

        X := a {{Q}}

      is locally consistent with respect to a precondition [P] if:

         (3) [d1] is locally consistent with respect to [P1]

         (5) [post d1 ->> Q]

         (6) [post d2 ->> Q]
*)
(** - A loop

      while b do {{Q}} d end {{R}}

      is locally consistent with respect to precondition [P] if:

         (1) [P ->> post d]

         (2) [post d /\ b ->> Q]

         (3) [post d /\ ~b ->> R]

         (4) [d] is locally consistent with respect to [Q]
*)
(** - A command with an extra assertion at the beginning

       --> {{Q}} d

      is locally consistent with respect to a precondition [P] if:

        (1) [P ->> Q]

        (1) [d] is locally consistent with respect to [Q]

(** - A command with an extra assertion at the end

(** With all this in mind, we can write is a _verification condition

    proposition saying that all its decorations are locally
    consistent.

    Formally, since a decorated command is "waiting for its
    precondition" the main VC generator takes a [dcom] plus a given

(** * Finding Loop Invariants *)

(** Once the outer pre- and postcondition are chosen, the only
    creative part in verifying programs using Hoare Logic is finding
    the right loop invariants... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Slow Subtraction *)

(** The following program subtracts the value of [X] from the value of
    [Y] by repeatedly decrementing both [X] and [Y].  We want to verify its
    correctness with respect to the pre- and postconditions shown:

           {{ X = m /\ Y = n }}
             while X <> 0 do
               Y := Y - 1;
               X := X - 1
             end
           {{ Y = n - m }}
*)

(** To verify this program, we need to find an invariant [Inv] for the
    loop.  As a first step we can leave [Inv] as an unknown and build a
    _skeleton_ for the proof by applying the rules for local
    consistency, working from the end of the program to the beginning,
    as usual, and without any thinking at all yet. *)

(** This leads to the following skeleton:

        (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }}  ->>                   (a)
        (2)    {{ Inv }}
                 while X <> 0 do
        (3)              {{ Inv /\ X <> 0 }}  ->>          (c)
        (4)              {{ Inv [X |-> X-1] [Y |-> Y-1] }}
                   Y := Y - 1;
        (5)              {{ Inv [X |-> X-1] }}
                   X := X - 1
        (6)              {{ Inv }}
                 end
        (7)    {{ Inv /\ ~ (X <> 0) }}  ->>                (b)
        (8)    {{ Y = n - m }}
*)
(** By examining this skeleton, we can see that any valid [Inv] will
    have to respect three conditions:
    - (a) it must be _weak_ enough to be implied by the loop's
      precondition, i.e., (1) must imply (2);
    - (b) it must be _strong_ enough to imply the program's postcondition,
      i.e., (7) must imply (8);
    - (c) it must be _preserved_ by a single iteration of the loop, assuming
      that the loop guard also evaluates to true, i.e., (3) must imply (4). *)

(** ** Example: Parity *)

(** Here is a cute way of computing the parity of a value initially
    stored in [X], due to Daniel Cristofani.

       {{ X = m }}
         while 2 <= X do
           X := X - 2
         end
       {{ X = parity m }}

    The [parity] function used in the specification is defined in
    Coq as follows: *)

Fixpoint parity x :=
  match x with
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | S (S x') => parity x'
  end.

Definition parity_dec (m:nat) : decorated :=
  <{
  {{ X = m }} ->>
  {{ FILL_IN_HERE }}
    while 2 <= X do
                  {{ FILL_IN_HERE }} ->>
                  {{ FILL_IN_HERE }}
      X := X - 2
                  {{ FILL_IN_HERE }}
    end
  {{ FILL_IN_HERE }} ->>
  {{ X = parity m }} }>.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Finding Square Roots *)

(** The following program computes the integer square root of [X]
    by naive iteration:

    {{ X=m }}
      Z := 0;
      while (Z+1)*(Z+1) <= X do
        Z := Z+1
      end
    {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }}
*)

(* WORK IN CLASS *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Squaring *)

(** Here is a program that squares [X] by repeated addition:

  {{ X = m }}
    Y := 0;
    Z := 0;
    while Y <> X  do
      Z := Z + X;
      Y := Y + 1
    end
  {{ Z = m*m }}

    The _best_ precondition:

    one that as many states as possible can satisfy. *)
